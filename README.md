# Teaching materials for Core Quantitative Methods

This repo contains teaching materials for an introductory statistics and quantitative research course at postgraduate level. The [module guide](https://lukaswallrich.github.io/GoldCoreQuants/) is also accessible online; I am sharing this repo in the hope that others might find the content useful for teaching or learning.

If you have questions, or find that anything is missing (e.g., data), feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:lukas.wallrich@gmail.com) or raise an issue in this repo.
